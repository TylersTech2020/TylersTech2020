💻 IT Professional | Network Security Enthusiast | Business Owner

I’ve been passionate about technology since childhood—starting with building websites in 3rd grade and gaming during the Nintendo era. Today, that passion has grown into a career spanning telecommunications, IT, MSPs, and ISPs, where I’ve worked with both local businesses and corporate environments.

Currently, I run Tyler’s Tech Service, providing:

🖥️ Computer diagnostics, repair & sales

🌐 SOHO networking & configuration

🎨 Web design & development

I’m also expanding into cybersecurity, programming, and penetration testing, sharpening my skills on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Udemy. What began as curiosity has evolved into a drive to grow in the fields of IT security and software development.

Outside of tech, I enjoy sports, adventure, photography, and travel. Most importantly, I’m a proud new dad—sharing the world with my son while still being a lifelong gamer at heart.

🚀 Always open to connecting with other professionals in IT, cybersecurity, and technology to share ideas, opportunities, and growth.
